# Voice-Bridge

A **real-time speech assistant** that integrates **Speech-to-Text**, **LLM (GPT-2)**, and **Text-to-Speech** to create an interactive bot. This project combines Python libraries and machine learning concepts to turn voice input into smart responses and speak them back to you!

## 💡 What is Voice-Bridge?

Voice-Bridge is a cool project I built that:
- Takes your **voice input** via microphone 🎤
- Converts it into text using **SpeechRecognition**
- Sends the text to an LLM (**GPT-2**) for generating meaningful responses 🤖
- Converts the response back to **speech output** using **pyttsx3** 🗣️

Think of it as a small, DIY smart assistant like Alexa, but you control everything! 🚀

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Speech-to-Text**: Your voice is captured through a microphone and converted into text using Google’s speech recognition API.
2. **LLM Response**: The text is sent to a GPT-2 model, which generates a response based on the input.
3. **Text-to-Speech**: The response text is spoken back to you using a text-to-speech engine.

## 🔧 Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Voice-Bridge.git
   cd Voice-Bridge
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📚 How to Use

1. **Run the script**: Start the Python program using `python main.py`.
2. **Follow prompts**: The bot will ask you to speak into your microphone.
3. **Get a response**: The bot will think (aka generate a response) and talk back to you! 🔊

## 📝 Notes

- Make sure your **microphone works** and is set as the default audio input.
- Install **PyAudio carefully**. On Windows, use precompiled wheels if you face installation errors.
- This is not perfect! The GPT-2 model might generate some random stuff 🤷‍♂️.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use **SpeechRecognition** for converting voice to text.
- Working with **Hugging Face pipelines** to use GPT-2 for generating text.
- Using **pyttsx3** for text-to-speech conversion.
- Combining all these components into a functional project!

---

## 🌟 Future Improvements

- Replace GPT-2 with a conversational model like **DialoGPT**.
- Add a GUI to make it more user-friendly.
- Optimize performance for quicker responses.
